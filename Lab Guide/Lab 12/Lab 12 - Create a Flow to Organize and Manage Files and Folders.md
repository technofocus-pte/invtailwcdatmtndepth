# Lab 12 - Create a Flow to Organize and Manage Files and Folders 

**Objective:** The objective of this lab is to automate the process of
backing up files from a designated folder on the desktop using **Power
Automate Desktop**. Participants will create a flow that copies files
from a folder named **Contoso_Files**, moves them to a newly created
backup folder, and appends a timestamp to the backup file. This lab
provides practical experience in automating file management tasks,
including creating folders, copying files, and renaming them with
dynamic date and time formats.

**Estimated Time:** 20 mins

### Conclusion: 

In this lab, participants successfully created a Power
Automate Desktop flow to automate the organization and management of
files and folders. By backing up files from a designated folder named
Contoso_Files to a newly created backup folder, participants gained
hands-on experience in essential file management tasks, including folder
creation, file copying, and dynamic file renaming with timestamps. This
lab highlights the effectiveness of Power Automate Desktop in
streamlining file organization processes, reducing manual effort, and
ensuring that important files are securely backed up. Participants left
with practical knowledge of how to leverage automation for efficient
file management, enhancing their productivity in everyday tasks.
